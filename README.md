This is a modern implementation of the ancient game of hnefatafl. You can see it live and in action here: https://www.hnefatafl.app . It is written using nextjs. The game logic is expressed as a set of TS functions and the rendering takes place only using HTML and CSS.

It includes a rudimentary AI as well as a multiplayer mode using MongoDB.
